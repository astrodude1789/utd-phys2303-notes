Cody's Notes for UTD's PHYS 2303 (Contemporary Physics)
-------------------------------------------------------
Hello! These are my notes for Dr. Khan's Contemporary
Physics course in Fall 2017 at UT Dallas. These notes
are free, available for anyone to use, reuse, or share
by the rules of the MIT license.

Please note that this implies no warranty in the notes
and that they are provided as-is as a reference tool.
This is a student project with the intent to be useful
and is in no way affiliated with Dr. Khan or the UTD
physics department. Don't contact her if there's some-
thing wrong in here. Additionally, follow all the rules
of academic honesty when using these notes.

Thanks for reading the most boring readme ever!
